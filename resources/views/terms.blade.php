                                    Trading of VFAs involves significant risk. The risk of loss in trading or holding VFAs can be substantial. You should therefore carefully consider whether using the Spot Services or Additional Services is suitable for You in light of your financial condition.

Prices can and do fluctuate at any given moment for any reason. Due to such price fluctuations, You may gain or lose value in your assets at any given moment. Any VFA or trading position may be subject to large swings in value and may even become worthless.

The User must effectively cooperate, otherwise, we will take actions, including, but not limited to restrictions on account transactions, freezing account funds, prosecution of the User in a court with right of jurisdiction and other recourse measures. In the event that the User does not cooperate, the User will also bear recourse costs.
